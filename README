This code requires Unidata's "udunits" library and header files, which
are available from:

http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/udunits/

I've tested this with udunits library vesion 1.11.7.  Presumably newer
versions will work as well; don't know about older ones.

The Makefile tries to find the udunits library and header files.  However,
if they are installed in a location that is not found, then this won't
compile.  In that event, the Makefile should be edited to explicitly put
in the location of the udunits library and header files.
